This project centers on recreating hemispheric debates about race and emancipation through the digital recreation and contextualization of the transnational networks of the Spanish and Portuguese language press of the U.S. As part of the larger project, I am interested in how Cuban, Puerto Rican and Brazilian press in the U.S. mobilized practices of newspaper editing, such as reprinting and visual layouts, to reach wider audiences and influence the public sphere in the U.S., the Caribbean, and Latin America.

I argue that these non-English language newspapers were pivotal for the development of racial discourses across the hemisphere and that their nature as diasporic, as opposed to nationally, produced newspapers offers a rare chance to understand the circulation of racial constructs during the 19th century. Simultaneously, I am interested in why materials like these papers, which I term diasporic newspapers, have too often been excluded from the historical record of histories of race and how their inclusion in the digital cultural record can reframe how we practice digital humanities as a more expansive and inclusive discipline that is responsive to the ways that diverse voices create and express knowledge.

This particular project is a section of the first chapter of my dissertation which focuses on a case study of an abolitionist periodical in 19th century New York, edited by Cubans and Puerto Ricans titled _La América Ilustrada_, the famed Cuban newspaper _el Diario de la Mariana_, and the _New York Herald_. From late 1872 until mid 1873 all three papers were involved in a very public and heated exchange related to Herald correspondent that traveled to Cuba. This episode demonstrates how information was constantly traveling and being reinterpreted across languages, geographies, and political affiliations.

In the Herald’s view, their reporter had been forced into a hasty escape from Cuba after El Diario published an incendiary letter from its New York correspondent and a follow up article that put him at risk of being arrested or executed by Spanish authorities. They further claimed that Herald’s favorable depictions of the insurgency had caused consternation on the island because they ran counter to the official narrative reported in El Diario. The letter from El Diario’s correspondent in New York and subsequent articles insisted, however, that the original affront had been committed by the editors of the Herald whose reporter had travelled to Cuba under false pretenses which led to his detainment. The two newspapers continued to trade blows months later, with El Diario accusing the New York publication of having lost its standards to the point of printing, “unas paparruchas inventadas en la agencia laborante y puestas en forma de documentos mambises acabados de llegar de la manigua.”

In responding to the charge of printing false documents and serving as the mouthpiece of the Cuban insurgents, the Herald’s response alluded to the Spanish government’s control of the newspaper by mocking the writer of El Diario in saying that: “A correspondent with such wonderful sources of information at his command and so great an acquaintance with the inner life of New York journalism must be of inestimable value to the Diario, which is a somewhat dull and sombre sheet, with that air of officialism”.

The dispute between the newspapers reveals an interconnectedness and familiarity between the public spheres of Cuba and the U.S. It also reveals the contest to control the circulation of news. In essence, the allegations of printing false documents and operating as state media are arguments about the veracity of circulation. That is, if it's printing fabricated news or only the perspective of a colonial government, can a newspaper actually be part of the flows of information in the modern print networks, or is this image merely a fabrication. 

Many other newspapers, telegrams, letters, and official communiques moved up and down the Atlantic offering and contesting information. At times documents came within documents as in the letter from the New York correspondent printed in _El Diario_, telegrams in the _Herald_ or the translations of these reports in _La América Ilustrada_. In other cases, it was left to the reader to decipher the web of references through which the information had traveled until reaching its articulation on the page, who was being addressed, and the extent to which this transnational imagined community stretched.

## Remediating methods

How can exchanges be recovered when they are only implied on the page or are limited to references to newspapers that have disappeared from the archive? My approach is what I alled "networked reading" of <em>La América Ilustrada</em>. My intention is to point out the interlocutors that shaped the discourse in the newspaper and that are scarcely represented beyond the citations and reprints included in the text. In order to understand the discourse in <em>La América Ilustrada</em>, I argue that it is essential to reintroduce the external and internal flows of information. I analyze a selection of articles as they were participated in the material circulation, where and when it was expected to be read, as well as the other potential newspapers and narratives that co-created the discursive formation. 

As the <em>Herald</em>’s report came in, so did the idea that the majority of the forces were Black soldiers, shirtless and barefoot. But, to the dismay of the political power on the island represented by <em>El Diario</em>, also motivated and well-organized. In their translation of the reports, however, the editors of <em>La América Ilustrada</em> deracialized soldiers, focusing instead on the poor conditions of their camp and weapons as part of a long-standing plea by the paper for monetary and equipment support from the U.S. and other nations. These are threads and tensions that emerge as the interpellations to audiences and contexts are reconnected into conversations.

In order to approach these issues, I collected the date, title, and topics of every article of the first two years of publication that included a reference, reprint, mention or translation of another newspaper, as well as the titles and editors of these newspapers. I differentiate between references that address the content of the newspaper being cited, from mentions which did not include more information other than the name of the paper. The editors of <em>La América Ilustrada</em> often expressed the ideological and physical geographies of the newspaper as central to its editorial program which led me to also collect the city and country in which the newspapers were published. In the same way, I included the language in which the article could be found in <em>La América Ilustrada</em> and in the original publication so as to engage with the newspaper’s representation of language as a constitutive part of a cultural, rather than just a geographical, community. The resulting networks show the newspaper’s expanding circulation as stemming from a mix of Latin American, Latino and North American sources even as it continued to proclaim itself as the translator of “los principios politicos i sociales que han llevado a los Estados Unidos a su actual esplendor.”

The small dataset constructed from a Spanish-language publication offers a different possibility to the arguments made through large scale cultural analytics projects focused on periodicals. The latter rely predominantly on white, English-language periodicals. Instead, I find that in the case of <em>La América Ilustrada</em>, diasporic Spanish-language newspapers could contingently leverage English-language titles with larger circulations in the U.S. to provide validation for particular political projects. The <em>Herald</em>, for example, becomes a stand-in for a U.S. press system in a number of <em>La América Ilustrada</em>’s articles. My interest in recreating and interrogating the use of these networks lies in demonstrating the role of circulation in diasporic newspapers and what the use of these technologies meant for the central debates associated with nation-building and racial identity in Cuba.

While the contradictions between the articles related to Cuba that discuss abolitionism and those that primarily rely on a deracialized discourse may be evident at the text level, recreating the network created and projected by <em>La América Ilustrada</em>is an attempt to destabilize the harmonious narrative suggested by the glossy pages and the careful layout of the content. In other words, the presence of other newspapers within its pages reveals the constructedness of the page, which in turn mirrors the ways in which abolitionist discourse, sovereignty, and internationalization of the Cuban insurgency are themselves rhetorical constructions also predicated on circulation.


My goal is that recreating this mobility and circulation as a guiding principle of visualizations presents these materials and debates anew. Thank you slide! 

This project would not have been possible without the guidance, support and patience from doctors Carolina Villarroel, Lorena Gautherau, and Gabriela Baeza. ¡Mil gracias!
