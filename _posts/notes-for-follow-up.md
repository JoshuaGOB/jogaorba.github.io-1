# Specifications grading:

Linda Nielsen Alternative to rubric based teaching

Best for introductory courses. Idea is to provide students with a variety of projects they can work on more in-depth as a response to the different skill sets without skipping any of the _core DH_ methods and readings. It was based on a pass fail that took total number of projects completed rather than profficiency in particular tools for single projects. (Sally Hadden, Western Michigan, sally.hadden@wmich.edu)
